\title{Calculate Regions of Significance for \code{lm()} Interactions}
\usage{
lmROS(
  obj,
  interest,
  moderator,
  mod.type = 1,
  int.range = NULL,
  mod.range = NULL,
  alpha.level = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{Model object containing either a Quantitative by Quantitative interaction or a Quantitative by Categorical interaction from lm().}

\item{interest}{Variable of interest in the model. Must use quotes.}

\item{moderator}{Variable designated as the moderator in the model. Must use quotes.}

\item{mod.type}{Defines the TYPE of interaction. Must be an integer of 1 or 2. 1 = Quantitative by Quantitative. 2 = Quantitative by Categorical. Defaults to 1.}

\item{int.range}{Optional. Defines the range of the variable of interest to be graphed. Only used when mod.type=2.}

\item{mod.range}{Optional. Defines the range of the moderator to be graphed.}

\item{alpha.level}{Designates the alpha for the Region-of-Significnace. Defaults to 0.5.}
}
\description{
This function takes the work of Bauer and Curan (2005) and applies it to a linear model object produced by \code{lm()}. Currently, the function handles two types of interactions in the \code{lm()} model: (1) Quantitative by Quantitative, Johnson-Neyman Regions-of-Significance; and (2) Quantitative by Categorical, which produces a quasi Region-of-Significance marking values of the Quantitative variable at which the difference of the factor levels change significance.

\details{
The ROS graph produced is exported to the Global Environment as ggplot object which can be further edited.
